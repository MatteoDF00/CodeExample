# CodeExample
This repository contains, by way of example, only the source files of a larger group project.

The objective was to implement food recognition, classification, and leftover estimation utilizing C++ and OpenCV. 
Due to the dataset's limited number of image samples, a machine learning approach was not feasible. Consequently, a fundamental image processing paradigm was employed.
